Early stage, expect footprint mismatches (especially regarding python3).
Please report errors.

1. enable the REPO on your CRUX system
  * put crux-libreoffice.httpup and crux-libreoffice.pub in /etc/ports
  * edit /etc/prt-get.conf to contain "prtdir crux-libreoffice"
  * also allow scripts to be run or watch out for scripts you need to run (eg. when installing mysql)
2. what else to check for?
  * *your first build?*
    * install python3 first and issue those commands afterwards (CRUX 3.4 as a basis):
      * `ln -s /usr/include/python3.6m /usr/include/python3.6` `ln -s /usr/include/python3.6m /usr/include/python3` `ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/python-3.6.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/python3.pc`
      * the reason for that is that libixion and py3boost will fail to find python3 without them and the build will fail
  * *not your first build?*
    * if you have harfbuzz installed (prt-get isinst harfbuzz) already, you need to rebuild it with graphite2 support
    * `prt-get depinst ragel graphite2 && prt-get update -fr harfbuzz`
3. `prt-get depinst libreoffice`
4. ???
5. Profit.
